B. Allowed Uses

  1. You may play with TCC in any form on any singleplayer or multiplayer server you choose.

  2. You may edit TCC and its assets for your own personal use, so long as you do not redistribute said edited content publicly. This does not apply to edited content that is sufficiently distinguishable as original and distinct from TCC content and that does not break any of the rest of this license.

    For example:
    - You are allowed to create an edited version without all features you dislike for personal use. You are not allowed to redistribute it.
    - You are allowed to use a personal edited version on your own private or public server.
    - You are allowed to create a "TCC but I remade every texture by hand in MS Paint" add-on pack and redistribute it.

  3. You may create and share your own TCC-related content, such as videos, fanart, and images so long as you do not charge for said content and it does not redistribute TCC or any of its assets.

    For example:
    - You are allowed to create a video series of your gameplay.
    - You are not allowed to create TCC merchandise and charge for it.


C. Denied Uses

  1. You may not redistribute TCC or any of its assets. This does not apply to simple mcfunction concepts. You are free to read TCC code and use it to learn.

    i. You may not use any of our resource pack assets or models for your own projects.
      For example:
      - You are not allowed to take TCC's wrench texture and create your own wrench data pack using it.
      - You are not allowed to use TCC's illager model for your own project.
      - You are not allowed to make TCC NFTs.

    ii. You may not use TCC's mcfunction code for your own projects. However, as noted above, this does not apply to simple, sufficiently generic mcfunction concepts.
      For example:
      - You may use simple concepts such as block placement or randomization techniques and use them in your own data pack.
      - You may not take all of the code for the wandering witch and redistribute it in your own "wandering mob" data pack.
      - You may not use the advanced, specialized soul conductor algorithm for your own data pack.

  2. You may not use TCC in any public modpack, datapackpack, or any type of compilation without express permission from the owner, which may be revoked at any time.
    For example:
    - You may not create a public compilation titled "Better Vanilla" combination of vanilla+ datapacks and include TCC without the owner's permission.
    - You may create your own private compilation and use it. (See B2)

  3. You may not pass off TCC or its assets as your own. Give proper credit where it is due.


D. Exceptions 

  1. It should be clear that all members of TCC's development team are exempt from any part of the above license at any time, for any reason, given their ownership of the content in question.
